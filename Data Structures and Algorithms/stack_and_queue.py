# Reminder:
#
# Stack:
#
# - A stack works on the principle of “Last-In, First-Out” (LIFO).
# - To implement a stack in Python, you can use a list. Use append() to add an item to the end and pop() to remove
#  the last item.
#
# Queue:
#
# - A queue works on the principle of “First-In, First-Out” (FIFO).
# - To implement a queue in Python, you can:
# 	  1.	Add items to the end using append() and remove the first item using pop(0).
# 	  2.	Add new items to the beginning using insert(0, item) and remove the last item using pop().
# -	Note: Both methods involve one operation that is not constant time (O(1)).
# 	To achieve constant time operations, use deque from the collections' module.
